Switch Ball: Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application (“Switch Ball”) for mobile devices that was created by NickJr. The Application is an offline free-to-play game that is about passing through obstacles. To pass the obstacles, you must switch the color of the ball with the color of the obstacle.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal data. All data preferences (like scores and etc) is stored only in your device and can be erased by uninstalling the app.

This app contains ads by Unity Ads (interstitial and rewarded ads) Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.

You have the option to opt-out to stop any automate collected data from ads unity and in-game purchases.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, please send me an email and I will try my best to help you.
